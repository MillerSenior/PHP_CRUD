Note: to run php files in terminal use command: php filename.php

1. Create connection to SQL through server and create a database:
-See createDB.php

2. Create your tables
-see CreateUserTable.php

Note: 
-For user separation in PHP, the user id has to be passed from page to page,
for some reason the PHP register functionality that I've come acress
will not allow the id to pass from the register handler into the site. It will 
take the user name but not the id. It forces the user to register, then login.
PHP8 Solutions had no remedy for this. Nor PHP Beginners Guide.
